Module 9 Assignment - Employee SQL
**Background to the assignment**
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
**Requirement**
  	Design tables to hold the data from the CSV files 
  	Import the CSV files into a SQL database 
  	Answer questions about the data. 

The challenge is divided into 3 parts –
  1.	Data Modelling
    	Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables.
